### What is Neon?

## Library usage

This is a fork of univalue used by Neon Core. It is not maintained for usage
by other projects. Notably, the API may break in non-backward-compatible ways.

Other projects looking for a maintained library should use the upstream
univalue at https://github.com/jgarzik/univalue.
